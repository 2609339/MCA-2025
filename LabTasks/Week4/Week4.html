    <h1>Week 4: Computational analytics of notated music</h1>
    <h2>1. Creating a jSymbolic analysis</h2>
    <p>This week's task involved making a jSymbolic analysis of our chosen piece of music and selecting what features were the most interesting and revelavnt for my piece.</p>
     <ol>

		<ul> <li> <b> Number of Pitches:</b> 78  </li>
		<li> <b> Number of Pitch Plasses:</b> 12 </li>
		<li> <b> Range:</b> 79 </li>
		<li> <b> Strong Tonal Centres:</b> 2 </li>
		<li> <b> Mean Pitch:</b> 60 </li>
		<li> <b> Mean Pitch Class:</b> 4.928 </li>
		<li> <b> Most Common Pitch:</b> 52 </li>
    <li> <b> Most Common Pitch Class:</b> 4 </li>
		<li> <b> Interval Between Most Prevalent Pitches:</b> 12 </li>
		<li> <b> Pitch Variability:</b> 14.43 </li>
		<li> <b> Mean Pitch</b> 60 </li>
		<li> <b> Most Common Melodic Interval:</b> 7 </li>  

		

	</ul>
	</li> 

	<h3>2.Creating a piano roll and a pitch histogram</h3>
		 <p> <b> Piano Roll </b></p>
		 <img src="piano_roll.png" alt="Piano Roll image" style="width:50%"> 
		 <p>The piano roll highlights certain aspects of the song for example, the clear and repeating melody of the song can be viewed in the piano roll if viewing the similar pitch patterns that recur across the C, D and G pitches.</p>
		 <p> <B> Histogram</B></p>
		 <img src="histogram.png" alt="Histogram image" style="width:50%"> 
		 <p>The histogram showcases how repetitive the song is as well as how the song is played by mainly focusing on the keys in the centre of the keyboard.</p>
