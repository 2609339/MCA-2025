    <h1> Week 2 </h1>
    <p>For this week's task i have transcibed the David Bowie song 'Space Oddity'. With the version of the song that i have transcribed being created for the piano, despite the instrument not featuring at all on the original song. Despite this the piano instrumental is still an accurate representation of the song's original instrumentation.</p>
