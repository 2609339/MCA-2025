    <h1>Week 3</h1>
    <p>For this week's task I had to export last week's MuseScore file into a MusicXML file and in turn create a MEI file from the newly created MusicXML file.The newly created MusicXML file can be downloaded <a href="Space Oddity - David Bowie (5).musicxml">here</a> and the newly created MEI file can be downloaded <a href="Space Oddity - David Bowie.mei">here.</a></p>
    <h2>MEI file rendered by verovio</h2>
    <p>Please find below the MEI file rendered by verovio.</p>
     
    <div id="app">Verovio is loading...</div>
    
    <script type="module">
        import 'https://www.verovio.org/javascript/app/verovio-app.js';
        
        const options = {
            defaultView: 'responsive', // default is 'responsive', alternative is 'document'
            defaultZoom: 3, // 0-7, default is 4
            enableResponsive: true, // default is true
            enableDocument: true // default is true
        }
        
        // A MusicXML file
        var file ='Space Oddity - David Bowie.mei'; //Replace this with your own MEI file, but remember that JavaScript is case sensitive!
        // A MEI file
        //var file = 'https://www.verovio.org/editor/brahms.mei';
        
        const app = new Verovio.App(document.getElementById("app"), options);
        fetch(file)
            .then(function(response) {
                return response.text();
            })
            .then(function(text) {
                app.loadData(text);
            });
    </script>
